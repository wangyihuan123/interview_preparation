what's infrared laser projectors do in realsense
“Active” stereo vision relies on the addition of an optical projector that overlays the observed scene with a semi-random texture that facilitates finding corres pondences, in particular in the case of texture-less surfaces like indoor dimly lit  white walls.
Furthermore, different types of projectors were used for each camera. The D415 uses two AMS Heptagon projectors,  while  the  D435  uses  an  AMS  Princeton  Optronics  projector  with  a  wider  emission angle  but fewer spots (~5000) .  The optical patterns from both models projected onto a flat wall are shown below, as recorded by a D435.
